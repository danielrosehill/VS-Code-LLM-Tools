The "gpt-token-counter-live" is a Visual Studio Code extension that displays the token count of selected text or the entire open document in the status bar. The token count is determined using these tokenizers for GPT and Claude.

This tool is built to get a speedy token counting result right on VS Code while you are working on prompting files. I personally needed a lot while working on many LLM projects, so I decided to make one for myself. I hope this helps you too

Install code:
`ext install bedirt.gpt-token-counter-live`
